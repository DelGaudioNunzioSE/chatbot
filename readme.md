This chatbot was developed as a university course project by a team of four people (including myself).
The main goal was to create a chatbot capable of answering questions exclusively related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), by implementing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.
The repository also includes the documents used by the RAG to generate answers: these are the course notes, which were carefully modified to improve the chatbotâ€™s ability to retrieve relevant information.
